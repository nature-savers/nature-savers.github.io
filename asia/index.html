            <p>Mumbai: With its size, population and aggravating air pollution, India needs 1,600 to 4,000 air quality monitors but has only 804 as of September 16, 2021, most of which are concentrated in urban areas, shows research. This, experts say, prevents India from knowing the true extent, scale and geographical spread of various pollutants, and limits the government's ability for preventive public health measures.

                India has nine of the 10 most polluted cities in the world, but with 200 particulate matter (PM) 2.5 monitoring sites in operation during the 2010-2016 period, India's air quality monitor density--about 0.14 monitors per million people--is below China (1.2), the United States of America (3.4), Japan (0.5) and Brazil (1.8), according to research from 2019.
                
                As a consequence, India does not accurately know the spread of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrous dioxide (NO2), respirable PM 10, the finer particulate matter or PM 2.5, lead, carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia. Chronic exposure to these pollutants contributes to the risk of developing ailments such as cardiovascular, respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

                Significant progress – albeit short-lived – was made to improving air quality in Beijing during the lead up to the Olympics in 2008.
                Five years later the Chinese government launched a nationwide action plan to monitor air quality and collect data.
                Pilot project in Cangzhou City aims to harness this big data through a platform that detects air pollution hotspots and sends information via an app to enforcement officers.
            
            The 2008 Beijing Olympics marked the start of significant action by the Chinese government to reduce air pollution in China. Concerns were raised over the impact of air pollution on athlete performance, and a wave of restrictions on polluting activities were implemented while the city sat in the global spotlight. Before the Games, 300,000 high polluting vehicles were phased out, major construction activities were halted, and hundreds of factories and power plants were shut down.

            <p>    6.5 million people die annually from exposure to poor air quality.

                70% of air pollution related death occur in Asia Pacific.
            
            Air pollution is the most pressing environmental health crisis in the world.  It is responsible for more than 6.5 million deaths annually, the bulk of which – 70 per cent –  occurs in Asia Pacific. In addition to health hazards, air pollution is a threat to the region’s economy, food and water security and climate systems. This hampers the region’s efforts to grow sustainably and alleviate poverty.Particulate matter, or PM10 and PM2.5, are fine particles with a diameter of less than 10 and 2.5 micrometers, respectively. Exposure can cause cancer and are linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. A gas with a sharp smell, generated during the combustion of fossil fuels. In addition to the risk to human respiratory system, when combined with air and water, sulfur dioxide or SO2 can form acid rain.</p>
